# Software Design

## Anti-Patterns

 - Postel's Law - also known as the *Robustness Principle*, was used when first developing Internet protocols, but should be avoided now in favour of stronger standards:

## Principles

 - Separation of Concerns
   (This explanation needs more work) An area of code should not concern itself with another area of code (eg: concepts, domain, etc.) if it isn't relevant. For example, the repository layer should not know about nor return HTTP status codes, this is the responsibility/concern of the API layer.
 
 - You aren't gonna need it (YAGNI)

 - Law of Demeter (Principle of least knowledge)
 
 - Don't repeat yourself (DRY) - One source of truth within the code.
 
 - Conway's Law
 
 - Levels of Abstraction
 
 - Consistency
 
### SOLID

 - Single Responsibility Principle

   There is a second question, as important as "does every class have only one reason to change?" and that is "does every change only affect one class?"
 
 - Open / Closed Principle
 
 - Liskov Substitution Principle
 
 - Interface Segregation Principle
 
 - Dependency Inversion Principle
