# General Terms

- Source Control (or version control) - is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code. Source control management (SCM) systems provide a running history of code development and help to resolve conflicts when merging contributions from multiple sources.

## Development Terms
- Idiomatic code - write for the system or language you are using - more efficient, less confusing
- Primitive obsession - write a specific type for the situation

## Acronyms
 - REPL - read-eval-print loop - a simple interactve programming environment that takes user input, evaluates and executes it, and returns the result to the user.  
   an example of this is C# Interactive in Visual Studio (View > Other Windows > C# Interactive)


## Coding Concepts
 - Guard Clause - provides a way for a method to exist quickly (fail fast) if certain conditions aren't met. This approach helps keep code cleaner.

 - Call Chains
   This is the different paths that a program can take to get to a point in code. Unsure whether this is the exact term, or other terms are more appropriate, for example:
   - Execution Path
   - Call Graph
   - Call Tree
   - Call Hierarchy
   - Code Flow
