# General Terms

- Source Control (or version control) - is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code. Source control management (SCM) systems provide a running history of code development and help to resolve conflicts when merging contributions from multiple sources.

## Development Terms
- Idiomatic code - write for the system or language you are using - more efficient, less confusing
- Primitive obsession - write a specific type for the situation

## Acronyms
 - REPL - read-eval-print loop - a simple interactve programming environment that takes user input, evaluates and executes it, and returns the result to the user.  
   an example of this is C# Interactive in Visual Studio (View > Other Windows > C# Interactive)


## Coding Concepts
 - Guard Clause - provides a way for a method to exist quickly (fail fast) if certain conditions aren't met. This approach helps keep code cleaner.

 - Call Chains
   This is the different paths that a program can take to get to a point in code. Unsure whether this is the exact term, or other terms are more appropriate, for example:
   - Execution Path
   - Call Graph
   - Call Tree
   - Call Hierarchy
   - Code Flow


## Running Code

- Instruction - An order given to a computer processor by a computer program. Traditionally an individual machine code instruction for a physical CPU. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_(computing)#Executable
- Command - A directive (single word, line of code or series of insturctions) given to a computer program to perform a specific task. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_(computing)
- Execution - Run (execute) an instruction or command. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_(computing)
- Statement - A command in a high level programming language that expands to multiple instructions in a low level programming language. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(computer_science)
