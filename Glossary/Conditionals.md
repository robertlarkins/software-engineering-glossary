# Conditionals

In code _conditionals_ (or conditional statements) occur frequently to determine which actions should be executed. A prime example is an if statement
```csharp
if (boolean-expression)
{
}
```

Conditionals are built up of boolean expressions which evaluate to a boolean value of true or false.
A boolean expression is a three-part clause that consists of two items to be compared, separated by a comparison operator. eg: `a < b`.
Compound boolean expressions (or compound condition) can be formed by combining single boolean expressions using logical operators (and `&&`, or `||`, not `!`).
Said another way, these individual boolean expressions are the component conditions of the compound boolean expression.
