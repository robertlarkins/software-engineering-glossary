> Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.  
> \— Melvin E. Conway

There is also the _Inverse Conway Maneuver_ which recommends evolving your team and organisational structure to promote your desired architecture.
