# Legacy Code

Legacy code is code that
- Code that scares you
- Code that's too scary to update and too profitable to delete
- Legacy code is simply code without tests (or effective tests) - Michael C. Feathers, Working Effectively with Legacy Code

Issue with confidence around moving forward - code that you are not confident in changing

Make the quest for confidence intentional

The more decoupled tests are from the codebase, the more confidently the codebase can be changed.
